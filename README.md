# Fermentador Compiler for Hoppy Language
 My compiler project for the Development of Advanced Applications of Computer Science	 module. I wanted to have fun while developing this project and made my own programming language focused in the brewing of craft beer concept. 
 So, to  better explain:
- The original input files used to test the functionality and give a mark are based in Pascal and Coco/R as chosen by school professor.
- Then these same files are translated using the 'oosettaStone.txt' dictionary and replacing the original tokens.
- The final program to be tokenize and parsed is written in 'input_hoppy.hppy' file.
 
 Have fun diving into fermented productions and hops from a different tree (AST),
 
 It is neccessary to install RPLY module using pip install or:
 <py -m pip install rply>
 and then check that the path where it got installed is the correct one (recommend using the global interpreter)
